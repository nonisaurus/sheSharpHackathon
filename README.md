# SheSharp Hackathon

This project documents our experience at our first hackathon on June 10th. Our names are Ana and Noni, and we were given the exciting task of creating something using an API that provides job listings. We were enthusiastic about the opportunity and decided to build a React app to display these job listings.

<br>

During the hackathon, we had a limited amount of time, and unfortunately, we couldn't complete the app within that timeframe. However, we had so much fun collaborating and brainstorming ideas that we both wanted to continue working on it independently. This led us to create separate branches in the project repository.

<br>

To showcase our progress on the actual hackathon day, we have kept the main branch unchanged. It demonstrates how much we were able to accomplish during the event.

<br>

On our individual branches, we are adding our own unique twists to the project. We believe this will give us the opportunity to explore different ideas and showcase our individual creativity.

<br>

Here are the links to our separate branches:

<br>

- [Ana's Branch](https://github.com/nonisaurus/sheSharpHackathon/tree/anaBranch)

<br>

- [Noni's Branch](https://github.com/nonisaurus/sheSharpHackathon/tree/noni-branch)

<br>

We hope you enjoy exploring our project and witnessing our journey from the hackathon to our individual branches. Your feedback and suggestions are always welcome as we continue to develop and improve our app.

Thank you for your support!
