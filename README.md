# SheSharp Hackathon - Noni

This project documents my side of the experience during our first hackathon on June 10th. My name is Noni, and along with Ana, we were given the exciting task of creating something using an API that provides job listings. We were both enthusiastic about the opportunity and decided to build a React app to display these job listings.

<br>

During the hackathon, we had a limited amount of time, and unfortunately, we couldn't complete the app within that timeframe. However, we had so much fun collaborating and brainstorming ideas that we both wanted to continue working on it independently. This led us to create separate branches in the project repository.

<br>

To showcase our progress on the actual hackathon day, we have kept the main branch unchanged. It demonstrates how much we were able to accomplish during the event.

<br>

On our individual branches, we are adding our own unique twists to the project. We believe this will give us the opportunity to explore different ideas and showcase our individual creativity.

<br>

Thank you for your support!
