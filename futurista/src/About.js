      <h4>created by: Ana & Noni</h4>
      <p>
        We were tasked to create a project of our choice with an API and job
        postings data from companies worldwide, provided by SheSharp and
        Reaktor. Please find the challenge details below.</p>
        <h2>The Goal of this Hackathon</h2>
        <p>
          Unleash your creativity and build something amazing with job postings
          data and APIs üë©‚Äçüíª‚ú®
        </p>
        <p>
          Let‚Äôs explore together the potential of job postings data and APIs to
          craft creative and empowering projects!
        </p>
        <p>
          As part of this Hackathon Coding Jam, we will give you, hackathon
          participants, access to job postings APIs and data from companies
          worldwide.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Discovering job openings that align with their criteria can be a
          frustrating experience for SheSharp's community members, especially if
          looking for remote work options, part-time or entry-level positions. By
          participating in this Coding Jam, you'll have the opportunity to develop
          a project that could potentially empower SheSharp community members with
          valuable tools, insights, and information.
        </p>
        <p>
          During this coding jam, you'll have access to expert mentors and
          resources to help you bring your ideas to life. And with opportunities
          to network with fellow participants and SheSharp community members,
          you'll be able to make valuable connections and gain new insights into
          the world of job postings and tech.
        </p>
        <p>
          The job posting data and APIs to be used during the hackathon is kindly
          provided by SourceStack.{" "}
